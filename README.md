A social network for android that allows to communicate with other users via chat, create or join groups, share location, an in-app mailbox and a lot more.

I was working on this project about 2-3 months and it's considered as my final school android project.

It was built using Java with Android studio.
The user after passing the login system can create groups with other users, chat with them, send them emails/receive system notifications. Also possible
to enable the option to show location to other group users on the map. The app has a lot more features than what i have mentioned here so be sure
to check the attached files(javadoc, pdf of project).

Most of the data is stored using google firebase.
